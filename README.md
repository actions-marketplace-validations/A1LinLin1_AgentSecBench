## See the path—not just the sink

| Discover | Explain | Enforce |
|---|---|---|
| Find shells, file operations, interpreters, browsers, network calls, credentials, and agent tools. | Connect agent-facing sources, call paths, trust boundaries, guards, operations, and potential effects. | Export SARIF, baseline existing findings, audit suppressions, and block only new policy matches in CI. |

AgentSecBench combines a conventional candidate scanner with a candidate-centered
**Security-Aware Agent Dependency Graph (Security-ADG)**. Every relation retains
source provenance and distinguishes structural evidence from inferred context.

## Quick start

Install the latest release and generate a complete offline report from the
built-in authored demo:

```bash
python -m pip install https://github.com/A1LinLin1/AgentSecBench/releases/download/v0.2.0/agentsecbench-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
agentsecbench doctor
agentsecbench demo --output agentsecbench-demo
```

Open `agentsecbench-demo/results/report/index.html`, then scan a real local
repository:

```bash
agentsecbench analyze /path/to/your-agent --output agentsecbench-results
```

```powershell
agentsecbench analyze H:\projects\my-agent --output agentsecbench-results
Start-Process agentsecbench-results\report\index.html
```

No corpus manifest or project configuration is required for the first scan.

## What one scan produces

| Artifact | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `report/index.html` | Offline visual investigation, graph comparison, notes, and review export |
| `findings.jsonl` | Stable candidate records for automation |
| `security-adg.jsonl` | Typed evidence graphs with provenance |
| `framework-coverage.json` | Modeled, signal-only, and generic-analysis coverage diagnostics |
| `results.sarif` | GitHub code scanning and compatible IDEs |
| `summary.json` | Run-level metrics and output locations |
| `policy.json` / `policy-summary.md` | New, existing, suppressed, and blocking CI results |

All primary machine-readable outputs have bundled, versioned JSON Schemas.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Agent repository] --> B[Operation & framework detection]
    B --> C[Local + project dependency analysis]
    C --> D[Guard & trust-boundary evidence]
    D --> E[Security-ADG]
    E --> F[Offline report]
    E --> G[SARIF]
    E --> H[CI policy]
```

The analyzer follows bounded direct calls and imports across Python and
JavaScript/TypeScript files. Dynamic dispatch, reflection, aliases, and inferred
boundaries remain visible limitations instead of being silently upgraded to facts.

## Framework-aware, not framework-locked

Built-in adapters recognize common entrypoint idioms from:

`MCP / FastMCP` · `LangChain` · `CrewAI` · `AutoGen` · `OpenAI Agents SDK` · `Semantic Kernel` · `LlamaIndex`

Custom adapters can be declared in `.agentsecbench.toml`. Every scan now reports:

- **modeled** — framework evidence reached at least one candidate graph;
- **signal only** — framework text was observed but semantic evidence was not attached;
- **not observed** — the adapter had no signal in scanned files; and
- **generic candidate files** — candidates were analyzed without framework context.

This diagnostic is a coverage aid, not a claim of complete framework support.
See [Framework coverage](docs/FRAMEWORK_COVERAGE.md).

## GitHub Action

```yaml
name: Agent security review
on: [push, pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  agentsecbench:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: A1LinLin1/AgentSecBench@v0.2.0
        with:
          path: .
          output: agentsecbench-results
          fail-on-new: "true"
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: agentsecbench-results
          path: agentsecbench-results
```

Start with a baseline so CI can focus on newly introduced candidates. Policy
filters never remove records from the report, JSONL, graph, or SARIF outputs.

## Research-backed engineering

The analyzer grew from a frozen real-world study rather than a toy rule set.

| Frozen study asset | Scale |
|---|---:|
| LLM-agent repositories | 67 |
| Agent ecosystems | 11 |
| Source files | 37,542 |
| Reproduction-confirmed security behaviors | 22 |

The public repository contains the implementation, deterministic fixtures, and
reproduction protocols. Third-party repository snapshots, credentials, raw
participant/model outputs, and coordinated disclosure material are not published.

## Status

AgentSecBench is an engineering preview. Output schemas are versioned
independently from the package, and CI covers the CLI, graph construction,
framework diagnostics, offline report, policy workflow, and release artifacts.
